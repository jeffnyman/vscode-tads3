# TADS 3 Language Extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds support for the [TADS 3](https://tads.org/) interactive fiction language in Visual Studio Code.

This extension adds syntax coloring to TADS 3 source files (`.t`), TADS 3 build files (`.t3m`) and TADS 3 library files (`.tl`).

This extension is a work in progress with the initial goal being simply to allow for a broad range of syntax highlighting.
